### The repository

This repository contains the second project for the Edx bootcamp. The goal of this project is to create a portfolio website to host our projects.

>Having a portfolio website is important because it allows you to showcase your work and accomplishments in a professional manner. A portfolio website serves as an online resume, highlighting your skills and experiences for potential employers or clients. It can also help you to stand out in a crowded job market, as it gives you a platform to demonstrate your unique value proposition.

>A portfolio website can also be a useful tool for networking and connecting with others in your industry. By sharing your portfolio website with others, you can attract new opportunities and collaborations.

>In addition, a portfolio website is a great way to establish your personal brand and showcase your style and approach to work. This can be particularly important if you are a freelancer or entrepreneur, as it allows you to present yourself as a professional and establish your reputation in your field.

>Overall, having a portfolio website can be a valuable asset for anyone looking to advance their career or attract new business.
