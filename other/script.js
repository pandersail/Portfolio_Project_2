/*
1. declare a array variable to hold all the r p or s choices as strings
2. use prompt to prompt user for their input and show a message " choose r p or s"
3. computer chooses a random r p or s
    - use Math.random to generate a random number between 0 and the length of the array
4. we need to determine if the user wins, loses, or ties
    - declare variables for tracking wins, losses, and ties
    - if the user picks r and computer s the user wins
    - if user pick r and computer p then user loses
    - ****
    - use if else statements to evaluate all these conditions
5. update the score variables (wins, losses, and ties)
    - if user wins, then add one the wins var
    - if user loses, add one to losses var
    - is user ties, then add one to ties
6. prompt user to play again (repeat)
